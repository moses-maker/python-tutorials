OPERATORS
> They assist in arithmetic and logical operations on values

a) arithmetics operators
+ addition
- subtration
* multiplication
/ division
// floor division   25//2 = 12 gives you th e
** exponent   2 ** 2  
% modulus


b) Comparison operators
 > greater than
 < less than
 >= greater than or equal to
 <= less than or equal to
 != not equal to
 == equal to
 

c) Logical operators
 and operators
 or operators
 not operators

d) Assignment operators
 = This is the symbol for assignment operators.
We have compound assignment where assignment operators are 
combined with arithmetic operators:
+= addition assignment
-= subtration assignment
*= multiplication assignment
/= division assignment
%= modulus assignment
//= floor division assignment
**= exponent assignment
