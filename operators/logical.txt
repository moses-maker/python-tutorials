LOGICAL operators
They are used to evaluate two different operations
The result of the evaluation is always boolean expression(True or False).

examples
a) and 
> This operators indicates that the two operations that is operation_1 and operation_2
must be true, in order for the entire statement to be true.
b) or
> This operators indicates that the either or two operations that is operation_1 and
operation_2 can be true in order for the entire statement to be true.
c) not
> This operators reverses the outcome of an operation.

operation_1  P
a = 6
b = 2
P = a > b  

operation_2 Q
c = 9
d = 15
Q = c > d

print(operation_1 and operation_2)

print(Q and P)
