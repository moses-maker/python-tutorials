THIRD PARTY MODULES
>Third-party modules are packages created by the Python
community and not part of the standard library/built-in
functions.
> We usually store the list of all the third party modules
or packages your project depends on along with there versions
in a file called "requirements.txt"
How to generate and store the packages/dependencies
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

> To install the dependencies in another computer or machine
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

To install third party modules use the following command
> pip install <package-name>

Virtual environment
- A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that
contains a separate Python installation, along with its
own packages and dependencies
Important
a) Isolate project dependencies from the global Python installation
b) Avoid version conflicts between projects.
c) Easily share and reproduce environments using "requirements.txt"

How to activate a virtual environment
1. Create the virtual environment
        virtualenv "environment_name"
        - This is a third party module installed with pip
        - More advanced features and options
        - it can create virtual environment for different python versions

        python -m venv "environment_name"
        - Built-in
        - Only works with python 3.3+
        - Limited
2. Activating virtual environment
        - To activate the virtual environment
            environment_name\Scripts\activate

3. To create a file
        - echo > filename.py
