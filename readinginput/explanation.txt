READING INPUT
> In python input() function is used to take data from user when the program is running
> Thier are several ways of initializing variable or assigning values to variables
a) When the program is not running(static initialization)
> To initialize the variables with values when the program is not running
 we use the assignment operator ( = )
 Example:     total = 100

b) When the program is running (dynamic initialization)
> To initialize the variables when the program is running we use the 
input() function
Examples:
    variable_name = input("prompt")

> The "prompt?" statament is what is displayed on the screen indicating to the user  a value
 needs to be entered through the keyboard. 
> After the user enters a value and presses enter key, the value is extracted and stored in
 the address represented by the variable_name.
> The value is treated as a string automatically by default.
>Some of the ways to force the values entered from being treated as a certain type
we use a technique called - typecasting.


Type casting
> This is forcing values to be converted to a different data type.
> Typecasting is devided into two types:
a) implicit - the interpreter does the conversion.
    Example:
        t = 10.5
        r = 7 + 10.5
        here 7 which is an integer will be converted to floating point value for addition.

b) explicit - you do the conversion manually.
> We use the following typecasting functions:
    int() converts values to integer.
    float() converts values to decimal figures.

    with input() function.


Exercise
Write a program that takes the radius of a circle using input() function. 
Calculate the Area and Circumference of a circle. Display the results,
using print function.
