LISTS
Variables usually hold one value but sometime you would want a variable to hold more
 than one value. 
This is achieved by the use of lists.
List - is a container that holds a number of values.

list_variable_name = [item1, item2, item3]

Terms associated with lists
a) items - values/elements stored in a list are called items. 
All items in a list are a signed to a single variable.
b) index - items in a list are stored according to certain position 
denoted as index position.
> These index position are counted starting at 0-1000.
 
List syntax:
> List is created with two square brackets - [ ]
> Items are stored inside the list brackets
 Example:   list_name = [item_1, item_2, item_n]
> List can store combination or individual groups of integers, floating point values, strings or boolean.
indexing methods
Forward indexing(left to right) 0.....
Reverse indexing(right to left) -1......

Retrieving from a list
> An item in a list can be retrieved individually through its 
index position which starts at 0-N
Example;list_name=[35, 67, 43, 98, 54]   
        b = list_name[index]  b = list_name[7]
           print(b)

> we can also use reverse indexing to retrieve items from a list
e.g -1, -2, -3

Modifying a list
Lists are mutable because items in alist can be altered 
list_name[index] = "new item"

Slicing
> This is where a part of the list is extracted by specifying index range along with the colon(:)

    list_name[start_index:stop_index, step_value]
