DATA TYPES
> Data storage formats that specifies how values like numbers, 
strings, characters are stored and manipulated within a program.

> Types of data Types
a) Numbers
This includes:
i) Integers
    int()
    type() 
    - They are whole numbers without decimals. Examples: 5000, 200, 150.
    - They are represented by the following class in python - int()
    - To convert a value that has decimal to Integers we say:
        t = 12.95
        y = int(t)

ii) Floating point numbers
    - These are numbers with decimals. Examples: 78.95, 453.93, 245.35
    - They are represented by the following class in python - float()
    - To convert a value to floating point figure we say:
        t = 78
        y = float(t)

b) strings
> It is a sequence of one or more characters, which includes letters
, numbers and other types of characters
> A string can contain the spaces between the words.
> String can be represented using

i) single - ' '
ii)double triple or single triple quotes. 
    """
    Text appear here.   
    
    """
    
    '''    
    Text appear here.
    
    '''

c) Boolean
> They are binary datatypes. They include( True and False).
> They are the outcome of evaluating control flow 
statements, comparison and logical operators.

print(True and False)


d) None
>It is a special datatype that indicates the absence of a value.
> Example:   total = None.
