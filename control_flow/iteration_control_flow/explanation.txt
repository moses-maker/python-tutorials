ITERATION STATEMENTS
> Iteration statements are used to execute a statement a particular number
of times, upon a condition evaluating to True.

> Examples:
    a) while loop
    b) for loop

a) while loop
    the syntax is:

    control_variable  = value
    while condition:
        statement(s)
        increment_statement(s)

    i) control_variable
    > It is updated by the new value everytime new Iteration occurs

    ii) while condition:
    >The loop will continue iterating as long as the condition is True.
    >When the condition is True, the statement will be executed.
    >After that, the increment_statement is executed. The value from it
    is used to update the control_variable, which intern determines if
    the condition is True or False.
    >Itcan result to infinit loop.


b)for loop
> The for loop is a controlled loop, it cannot be infinite.
> The syntax:
        for iteration_variable in sequence:
            statement(s)

> membership operators include:
    i) in
    ii) not in

> It starts with the keyword for followed by iteration_variable
> The iteration_variable can be any valid variable name.
> sequence  - range()
    * the sequence includes: range(start, stop, step)
    * range(start, stop, step)
        - start > the start value indicate the beginning of the 
        sequence. 0 is the default
        - stop > generates numbers up to this value but not 
        including the value itself.
        - step > indicates the difference between every two 
        consecutive numbers in sequence.

THE CONTINUE AND BREAK STATEMENT
a) break
> It is used to stop the execution of the loop.
> When a break statement is encountered in a loop, the loop
stops.

b) continue
> Continue is used to give an indication hat certain part
of the program has been reached but does not exit the loop
