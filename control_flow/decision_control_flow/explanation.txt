CONTROL FLOW STATEMENT
> Execution usually happens sequentlially, from top to bottom.
> You can use decison and looping control flow statement to break the flow of execution.
> Control flow statement enables you to execute a certain block upon evaluation.
> The execution of statement is determined by evaluation of a decision which can be boolean 
expression either True/False.
> Examples of control flow statements include:

a)Decision control Flow statement
> The execution of a block of statement under the if header depends on evaluation of a 
conditional statement of which if it is True, the statement under it is executed, if false 
the default condition is evaluated under which the statement get executed.

> They include:
i) if statement
ii) if ...else statement
iii) if ...elif ...else statement
iv) Nested if statement

i) if statement
    if condition:
        block/statement

> In order for the block/statement to be executed the condition must be true.
> If the condition is False the block/statement is skipped. 
> Execution of the block/statement depends upon evaluation of the condition.
> The block/statement is indented hence part of if block/statement.
> The condition must be followed by full colon(:)


ii) if ...else statement
> It has two option in that in the situation the conditional statement in the  if header block is false, 
the else part is evaluated and the statement under it is executed.

if condition:
    block of statement

else:
    block of statement

> In order for a statement to belong to either if block or else block, it has to be indented inside it
> The indentation is usually four spaces or one tab.


iii) if ...elif ...else statement
> This has three options to be considered that is (if) ,(elif) and (else). 
> if the conditional statement on if header (if) is false, then the (elif) is considered also if the condition
is false, now the default (else) part is considered.

if condition:
    block of statement

elif condition:
    block of statement

else:
    block of statement



iv) Nested if statement
> This is multiple if statements stacked inside each other. and evaluation happens in the order in which They
are stacked.
> In situation one (if) block is false, its (else) counterpart is evaluated and statement under it is 
displayed.

if condition:
    statement block

    if condition:
        statement block

        if condition:
            statement block

        else:
            statement block
    
    else:
        statement block

else:
    statement block
